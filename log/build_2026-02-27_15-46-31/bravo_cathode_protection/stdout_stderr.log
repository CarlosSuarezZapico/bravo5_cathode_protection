CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgeneral_libs_unite.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "general_libs_unite", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "general_libs_unite" with any of the following names:

    general_libs_uniteConfig.cmake
    general_libs_unite-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "general_libs_unite" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "general_libs_unite_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "general_libs_unite" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
